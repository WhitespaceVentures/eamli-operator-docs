# eamli runbooks
eamli is provided with some default prometheus alerting rules, which help teams manage their eamli products.

Each alert has a corrisponding runbook, which can be found here, which will help you resolve these alerts.

Alternatively, if an alert is raised without a runbook, please reach out to use at support@eamli.com.

## Creating new alerts
All runbooks for eamli should be generated using the template found within this directory, omitting sections that are not relivant. You can view the template [here](/runbooks/template.md), and an example runbook [here](/runbooks/EamliExampleAlert.md)
